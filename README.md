## Problem Statements

### Problem Statement 1: IPL Data Analysis and 2025 Winner Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing Indian Premier League (IPL) data from its inception to the latest season. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the development of a prediction model to forecast the winner of IPL 2025.

#### Key Features:

- **Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering**: Handling missing values, outliers, and feature extraction.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Team and player performance analysis, seasonal trends, and key statistics.
- **Winner Prediction Model**: A model to predict the IPL 2025 winner based on historical data and performance trends.

#### Tools and Libraries:

- Python, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

### Problem Statement 2: Research Article Summarization Using Advanced NLP Techniques

This project aims to develop a hybrid text summarization framework that combines extractive and abstractive techniques to summarize research articles. The framework leverages state-of-the-art NLP models like BERT and Longformer Encoder-Decoder (LED) to generate concise and coherent summaries.

#### Key Features:

- **Extractive Summarization**: Uses BERT to identify and extract key sentences from the text.
- **Abstractive Summarization**: Uses LED to generate a concise summary from the extracted sentences.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: ROUGE and BLEU scores to measure the quality of summaries.

#### Tools and Libraries:

- Python, transformers, sentence-transformers, torch, ROUGE, BLEU
